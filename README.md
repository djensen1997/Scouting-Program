# Scouting-Program

  This is an intuitive scouting program for FIRST teams who want to use a pc to scout other FIRST teams at
competition.  It has methods to make an impressive data base over several years and competitions all opperating independently.  This program was designed to be as usable as possible for as many years as possible.  At the end of the competition, the program can output the top 20 teams (max) in a specific metric for each individual competition.  Also, there is an overall top team that will output the top 30 teams based on predifined scaling for each metric by the user.
